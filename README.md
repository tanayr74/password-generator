#Password Generator
 
A password generator is a software tool or algorithm designed to create strong, unique passwords. These passwords are typically generated randomly, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.I created a password generator using Tkinter library in Python that :
1. Generates a random password on verifying that the password length is greater than 8 characters
2. Calculates Shannon Entropy,Character Distribution Entropy and Password Cracking Time
3. Provides the functionality of copying passwords to clipboard
